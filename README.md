# this is a simple todoapp that i made in react.js
sadly there is an limitation with the way it is hosted on Github Pages. There is no local storage. This means that after editing a todo the others will have disappeared. this is not a bug but simply a limitation of the way i chose to host it. (it was the cheapest and easiest way possible)
